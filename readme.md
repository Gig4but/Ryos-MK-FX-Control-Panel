### About Equalizer:
  In .zip archive is compiled "Equalizer" effect. Just exec and have fun!
  
  All files from archive must be in one folder with .exe file for success run.
  
  For program turn off, just press "Home" button and keyboard will return to previous state.
  
  It's not a real program work, just capture from Roccat SWARM.
