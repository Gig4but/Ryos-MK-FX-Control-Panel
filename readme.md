### Dependicies: 
  Roccat SWARM doesn't install **ROCCAT TalkFX** automatically now, which **is needed for program and keyboard comunication**.  
  Simply use installer from dependicies folder or download it from official site https://support.roccat.com/s/downloads.  
  (select Keyboards -> select Ryos MK FX -> click the bottom one button with text "ROCCAT® Talk® FX" -> install and restart computer)
  
### About Equalizer:  
  In Visualizer_vXX.zip archive is compiled "Equalizer" effect. Just exec and have fun!  
  **DO NOT FORGET ABOUT DEPENDICIES**
  
  All files from archive must be in one folder with .exe file for success run.
